## Purpose

- Online visual representation (brand) through design.
- A display of my skills so far.
- Scope of my professional skills and experience so far.
- A way for recruiters / clients to engage / contact me.

## Challenges / Decisions

- Bare-bones HTML or framework? 
- What content, design and layout? Keep it simple and consistent.
- Who is my audience? Recruiters / potential clients.
- What do I need my audience to be able to do?
- Clear <!-- commenting and formatting of code -->. 
- Fixing bugs.

## Design

Figma was used to iterate a mobile first design, look and feel, brand and colour scheme. I helped anchor my coding and kept me focused on the scope of this job. First impressions count so I wanted the site to be a impressive but simple. The navigation needed to be simple and effective so as to not disengage the user. I also used design to draw the eye of the viewer to my resume download by creating a stand out button.

## Inspiration and Influences

I've found that influences can be both inspiring and confusing but are very important and welcomed. 

- Dribble.
- Medium â€“ Inspiring web design stories.
- Minimalist layouts.
- DevIcons - awesome!
- Bootstrap 4.
- Treehouse (Bootstrap 4)
- [Circular Chaos][4] - was a big influence at the start in terms of colour.
- The people at Coder Factory, Melbourne.

## CSS

I used a custom local CSS when needed and used Bootstrap 4 to provide most of the layout and responsiveness. 

## Images & Icons

For images I used hero type backgrounds for each of the 4 sections. I thought they make an impact and can add emotion to the pages. I exported them as jpg's from Figma and gave them their own asset folder. Similarly I have added a folder for icons which I got from [DevIcons][3]. Icons were used for the scope of what we are learning here at Coder Factory and for call to action buttons such as Github, Linkedin and click to call functionality.

## Meta tags

I add `description`, `author`, `social media description` and `title` meta tags to my primary page: I designed a scrolling single page so this stuff is at the top of that html.

## Asset Links

- [CSS](css/main.css)
- [Home HTML](index.html)
- [Icon Assets](icons/)
- [Image Assets](/images/)
- [Downloads](downloads/)
